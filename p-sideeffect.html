                    <h1>side effects (of being human)</h1>
                    <p>A Puzzle-Narrative Graphic Adventure about Glenn, a fae that strives to be loved and accepted as a human being.<br>
                   Glennthrìghde, or as they prefer to call themselves, Glenn, is a Fae, but their goal is to live among humans. Except that part where they tried it, and it didn’t work, because Fae simply don’t work like humans, especially when it comes to emotions. Now Glenn is trying to fix that using their ability to steal emotions for themselves as long as other people feel these emotions. The player controls Glenn in their dream world, interacts with humans who are trapped in there and solves puzzles to find memories that Glenn can use to evoke certain emotions to steal them. <br>Except that part where being human is not as easy as Glenn always thought. It’s a game about emotions and the denial of emotions, of past regret and pretending, and about how sometimes you have to feel painful things to be human and alive.</p>

                        <h2>what I did in this project</h2>
                         <p>Here we come to, by far, my favourite game. For our narrative project my design-mate Isaac Baltsch and I created a framework of a story that he then filled out while I got started with riddle design. Something I had never done before, but unexpectedly fell in love with. For each level I created three puzzle types. Two of them being repetitive for level 1 and two and a special riddle for each level: </p> <br>
                       <ul>
                            <li>4 x unblock riddles per level</li>
                            <li>3 x connecting dots per level</li>
                            <li>1 x lock-key riddle; level one</li>
                            <li>1 x einstein riddle; level two</li>
                        </ul><br>
                       <p>
                           I additionally thought about where and how to include those riddles into the gameworld / level since it was my responsibility to make basic level layouts. <br>

                           Since we had a little time struggle at the end of the project phase (don’t we all?) I helped our fabulous artist Angelo Wedel out by drawing some UI buttons, speech-, and thought bubbles as well as the assets for my riddle.
