                    <h1>Juggernaut Legacy -<br> Witches vs. Gunslingers</h1>
                    <p>Juggernaut Legacy is a mobile mixed reality game. It combines human interaction and environmental interaction via an app game. The game itself consists of two fractions that try to succeed each other. This is done by gathering  Personal Points (PP) which are summed up to the total of all Team Points (TP). The team with the  most TP at the end of a fixed term winns.  <br> PP are gathered by 'fighting' against a member of the opposing team. Players earn in-game money by every interaction the make. With the money players can buy items which benefit their play. Certain actions can only be accomplished at certain locations.</p>

                        <h2>what I did in this project</h2>
                         <p>For this game my design partner and I spent the first project weekend together working out the main concept of the game. We thought about simple childhood games that do not need any physical requirements and are mainly inclusive for everyone to play as ‘battles’ for the two factions. <br>
                        Once we had made the basic concept together I got to make a narrative around it, to get the player emotionally invested into the game. As a general genre we settled on cyberpunk fantasy as a group from the beginning. And as for the tropes I, again, thought about childhood idols and then created several storylines for my team partners to decide for one: <br>
                       </p>
<ul>
    <li>Witches vs. Treefolk: after a faithful accident, in which a group of activists tried to magically heal a forest the trees became alive. After the trees saw what the humans did to their people they begin to fight back</li><br>
    <li>Witchfolk vs. Aliens: A group of archeological interested witches heard about an old artefact buried in a temple and when they tried to recover the artefact they accidentally opened a portal. Not only a portal but the toor to a forgotten prison. Inside a group of aliens that once roamed the world and introduced science to humans before they got greedy and wanted to rule the world</li><br>
    <li>Witches vs. Familiars: The loved familiars (cats) of many witches suddenly made an evolutionary jump and evolved opposable thumbs, which made them particularly powerful. Only  few years later a revolution shakes the world and the former familiars freed themselves from their bounds with the magic folk</li><br>
    <li>Witches vs. Gunslingers: The futuristic megacity The Lab is the residence of The Witches in their coven, The Golden Circle and The Gunslinger gang The Ruby Riders. And what both groups want to possess more than anything else is the mysterious Juggernaut. A certain rivalry is predetermined.</li>
</ul> 
                       <p>As you can see I like witches and therefore wrote them into every trope idea (mind you there are several more but alas no one has the time to read those) and my team ultimately decided to go for Witches vs. Gunslingers. <br>

                       Since we do not show any environment on the app, nor have any cutscenes I created a few characters inhabiting the world, those are: <br>
                       </p>
<ul>
    <li>The Undertaker, Shopkeeper</li>
    <li>Sammy ‘The Hustle’ Yates, leader of the Ruby Riders</li>
    <li>Alys Tear, Supreme Witch of the Golden Circle</li>
    <li>Jenkins, the AI from the power station</li>
</ul>
                       <p>The only interaction the player has with those characters is over the manual and in a short dialogue when ‘entering’ the location, and during the intro scene to which I made a story panel for. <br>

                       After writing the perspective manual I created the UI blueprint for our app and prepared a gameplay test, together with my design-mate. <br>
                       After that I created a simple website for our game and a QR code that we printed out so the game would be available for everyone at the Cologne Game Lab and all students could play our game. <br>
