                    <p>With Equinox we are targeting the pc platform and it is a single player experience. The player will be invited to explore the level and themselves as they inspect the environment on their search for tarot cards. With those the topic of self reflection and -awareness follows.</p>

                        <h2>what I did in this project</h2>
                         <p>This project was made during the first online semester we had during Corona. It is rather a prototype of the game; exploring the possibilities of perspective and gravity in a level design. My design-mate Isaac Baltsch (I have worked with him on side effects - of being human as well) and I split the workload (similar to our previous project). With him working on the narrative part of the game-  writing the cards, working out what they will mean in the end- and me focusing on the level design and gameplay.
                            <br>
                        My goal was to create a level structure that had an Escher-esk style. Meaning: being full of optical illusions and a change of perspective being needed to navigate through the maze. I too looked into artists that have similar artworks (Marcin Bialas, Dean Ellis). 
                             <br>
                        Now, when I wanted to start building the level architecture I realized that it is far more complicated than originally estimated. I started drawing the penrose staircase (descending- ascending stairs) until it was natural to me and got out my Lego again to help me and my spatial thinking. I started with simple structures where the player could walk the level  „forward and backwards“ and then continued, step by step, to make them more complicated.
                        When I felt comfortable with that I started adding another direction, left and right, into the design to further complicate it and make the level more appealing and harder to solve for the player.
                             <br>
                        And since we decided to make the level in 3D I could make it easily with flat planes in Unity. Which I eventually did. The original idea was that the player can walk up to any edge and it flips accordingly to that, similar to the scene in Jim Henson's Labyrinth (1986) where Sarah (Jennifer Conelly) tries to run from Jareth the Goblin King (David Bowie), to find her abducted brother (Toby Froud) in the castle.
                        The Level has been simplified and pushed together a little bit because it would have gotten too big if I would have stuck to my original design. The players would have lost their orientation and even though that was kind of the idea with the level design it crossed the,very thin line of feeling frustrated rather than having fun. Therefore there are defined locations where, when the player steps on, the level flips.
