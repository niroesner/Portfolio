                    <h1>Enotita - Myth of Europe</h1>
                    <p> As Zeus looked upon earth he saw the most beautiful woman of Phoenicia, the princess Europa and fell in love with her. To avoid the suspicious gaze of his wife Hera he transformed himself into a beautiful bull and charmed the princess to fall in love with him as well. Soon his wife Hera found out about his affair and sends enemies after the two lovers, to ensure that her husband is not making any further mistakes. The two fugitives have to avoid obstacles and defeat enemies on their run from the wrath of Hera. <br> 
                        The game is a singleplayer jump and run game. It is created to enrage the player and to have him to learn the the structure and pathways of the level and to try several times to beat the level</p>

                         <h2>what I did in this project</h2>
                         <p>For this game I built a level that is nearly impossible to beat, when you play it for the first time. You can see a part of it below. It was intentionally created that way to ensure that the player has to go multiple times through it and learn it’s structure. <br>
                         Furthermore, since it was built in a self made engine (not by me but my crazy programmer-teammate), I had to learn to navigate in a complete new engine environment. And mind you the engine was working but in comparison to what, for example, I could have done in Unity my options were limited at best. <br>
                         Additionally I helped the artitst with some minor animations, since time was running short and they would have been left out otherwise.</p>
